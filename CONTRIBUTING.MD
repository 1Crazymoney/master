### How to setup environment

It is recommended to have both worker and master in their latest versions. So :
Fork [master](https://github.com/queue-xec/maste) and [worker](https://github.com/queue-xec/worker)

```bash
mkdir queue-xec
cd queue-xec
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/master
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/worker
cd worker ; yarn
cd ../master ; yarn
git checkout -b my_new_feature
... make your changes
git commit
```

### After environment setup
Start working on your test in develpment mode by :
```js
yarn run test:dev
```
Create unit test in parallel of actual feature.
No pull request will be accepted if not contains new unit tests if introduce new features , or fixes of bugs!


### On git commit :
After all test passed , commitizen will fire up and start asking questions about your commit.(Be honest)

If you have any issue during this , check issues , if cant found something related , open a new issue , any other contributor can help you.
